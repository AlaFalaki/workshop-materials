# Practical Deep Learning Workshop (2022)

This workshop is mainly designed to focus on the practical aspect of deep learning by using a flexible and easy-to-use framework called FastAl. It will mitigate lots of complexities and repetitive procedures. (e.g., implementing Neural Networks basic elements, training loops, saving/loading checkpoints, ...) It is a code-first session with some attention toward deploying models, and how to quickly make an MVP. (Possible to also cover Vision application if more time available) I will also try to show how it is possible to implement the same functionality with only PyTorch and peek under the hood.




## Pre-requisites

 * Basic Python
 * Google Account

 
## Files in This Repository

* Notbook [1](https://colab.research.google.com/github/AlaFalaki/workshop-materials/blob/main/2022-practical-deep-learning/01-NLP_Part1.ipynb), and [2](https://colab.research.google.com/github/AlaFalaki/workshop-materials/blob/main/2022-practical-deep-learning/02-NLP_Part2.ipynb) are covering Natural Language Processing.
* The [3rd](https://colab.research.google.com/github/AlaFalaki/workshop-materials/blob/main/2022-practical-deep-learning/03-Vision_Part1.ipynb), and [4th](https://colab.research.google.com/github/AlaFalaki/workshop-materials/blob/main/2022-practical-deep-learning/04-Vision_Part2.ipynb) one will discuss Vision.
* Last two notebooks ([5](https://colab.research.google.com/github/AlaFalaki/workshop-materials/blob/main/2022-practical-deep-learning/05-Vision_Demo.ipynb), [6](https://colab.research.google.com/github/AlaFalaki/workshop-materials/blob/main/2022-practical-deep-learning/06-NLP_Demo.ipynb)) are presenting two easy ways to demo your models.
## Run the Codes

You can easily open any of the notebooks and run the codes by clicking on the "Open in Colab" button at the top. (Or use the direct links in the above section) You can see the FastAI, and PyTorch versions (at the time of preparing this workshop) in the first notebook under the "Language Models + Classification" section.

 * PyTorch - 1.10.0+cu111
 * FastAI - 2.5.3

## Run the Demos

You need to have the pre-trained models to be able to run each demo. It is possible to either train the models yourself by following the workshop material, or download them from the google drive.

 * [Natural Language Processing model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X0H0Zbf_tOp58dMUFOq4I1UjLI0WRl3F/view?usp=sharing)
 * [Vision](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SKPZSr_doT9i88T4LQcqgM1mlHOwVL_3/view?usp=sharing)

Either way, upload the model in your Google Colab instance by opening the files tab from the left side menu and you should be good to go.

GL!
