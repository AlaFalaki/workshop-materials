# Practical Deep Learning 2021
## _With focus on NLP and Vision_

In this workshop, we covered both text and image classification tasks using both FastAi and PyTorch. Each session started with showing the capabilities of FastAi and then diving deeper into implementing the models and loading the data using the PyTorch library to better understand the concepts.

- Notebooks [1](https://github.com/AlaFalaki/workshop-materials/blob/main/2021-practical-deep-learning/01-NLP_Part1.ipynb) and [2](https://github.com/AlaFalaki/workshop-materials/blob/main/2021-practical-deep-learning/02-NLP_Part2.ipynb) cover Natural Language Processing
- Notebooks [3](https://github.com/AlaFalaki/workshop-materials/blob/main/2021-practical-deep-learning/03-Vision_Part1.ipynb) and [4](https://github.com/AlaFalaki/workshop-materials/blob/main/2021-practical-deep-learning/04-Vision_Part2.ipynb) cover Vision
- ✨[Last notebook](https://github.com/AlaFalaki/workshop-materials/blob/main/2021-practical-deep-learning/05-Vision_Demo.ipynb) presents a basic demo on how to use FastAi models with a basic UI✨

## How to run the Demo

You need to open the "[05-Vision_demo.ipynb](https://github.com/AlaFalaki/workshop-materials/blob/main/2021-practical-deep-learning/05-Vision_Demo.ipynb)" notebook in a Google Colab instance. Download the pre-trained model named "finetuned_cls.pkl" from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DPKt3-fu9KXUejXfTMvBaJq5X1vj9mRC?usp=sharing) and upload it to your active session. Run all the cells and use the FileUploader widget to upload an image and see the mode's prediction.


## Libraries

- PyTorch - 1.9.0+cu102
- FastAi - 2.4.1

> It is recommended to open the notebooks in a Google Colab instance. You can easily run them and follow the code.
